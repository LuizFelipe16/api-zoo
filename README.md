# API Zoo!

### Visiting zoos has always been something very good, a remarkable moment especially for small children, seeing different types of animals in one place, being able to see things up close that they could never see. This is the Zoo API! An api rest to create your own zoo, with your favorite animals.

Getting Started
=================

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.
